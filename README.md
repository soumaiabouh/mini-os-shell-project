# Mini OS Shell Project
University course project where we built a mini OS shell in C. The shell includes basic command functionalities such as 'quit', 'set', 'print', 'run', 'echo', 'ls', 'mkdir', 'touch', and 'cd'. We also implemented a simple CPU scheduler for process management using four different scheduling algorithms - First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest-Job-First (SJF), Round-Robin (RR) and Aging. The scheduler was implemented using a priority queue data structure and the system uses PCBs (Process Control Blocks) to keep track of each process.

**Collaborators:** Soumaia Bouhouia and Alex Andrianavalontsalama

**Skills Demonstrated:** C programming, process management, priority queue data structure, CPU scheduling algorithms.

This project demonstrates our ability to design and implement a functional mini OS shell in C, and our knowledge of process management and CPU scheduling algorithms. It showcases our skills in programming, data structures, and algorithm design, and provides an opportunity for us to apply the knowledge we gained in the university course.
